# gifsig ðŸŽµ

this is a gif signature creator which does the following:

-records a video of you signing your signature
-converts the video to a high quality gif
-ensures the video does not loop
-allows you to download the gif

the concept is about simplicity.
We need eggshell white for the body, and we need asset ideas in json format to create great icons.
